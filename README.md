# HackDFW 2016 Attack

For their 2016 [hackathon](http://hackdfw.com/), HackDFW decided to run a fun little [game](http://game.hackdfw.com/) to grant players prizes related to the hackathon.

This is our attempt to take advantage of their crappy security and siphon as many points as we can while breaking their game in the process. 

We did get the blessing of one of the devs: Benny Yan:

All in good fun :)

### Instructions
